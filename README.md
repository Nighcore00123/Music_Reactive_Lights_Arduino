# Music_Reactive_Lights_Arduino
This is my first Arduino Porject, my Goal was to create a programm that uses 2 microphones(KY-037 microphone), 1 roll of NeoPixel, and an Audio Analyzer Module, to make the NeoPixel Strip interact with music. The code is fairly basic(even though it took me a few months) and it should would with every music genre exept classical, 

# If you dont have 88 LED´s.
  if you dont have 88 LED´s avaliable you will have to change a few values: the amount of leds YOU have avaliable ("led_count"), and the values inside the "for loop".
  you can also play around with the values inside the "FreqReading" function for example what frequency the microphones should give the individual functions.
